### To-Test
* loader : The few new changes did not cause side-effects on some editors.
* Command : `:setName` method doesn't conflict when command with the same new name exists.

### To-Do
* Command : Implement what's marked as `TODO` at README.md
* Command : function `get` should return a key-value table when keep-false is on.
* Command : New arguments system. Maybe use both flags and positioned args, and add options, something similar to [argparse](https://github.com/mpeterv/argparse) library.

### Bugs
* *Missing Testing*
